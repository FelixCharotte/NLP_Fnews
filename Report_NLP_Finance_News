Introduction 

In the rapidly evolving landscape of financial markets, timely and accurate information is paramount. With the increasing influence of digital media, the sentiment expressed in news articles has become a critical driver of market movements, particularly in the volatile realm of cryptocurrencies. Recognizing this trend, our project aims to leverage cutting-edge natural language processing (NLP) technologies to analyze sentiments expressed in financial news titles related to Bitcoin, the leading cryptocurrency. 

The primary goal of this project is to develop an NLP model that can accurately predict market trends—bullish or bearish—based on the sentiment derived from daily news titles. This approach is grounded in the hypothesis that fluctuations in Bitcoin prices are significantly influenced by public sentiment, as reflected through the media. By automating the extraction and analysis of sentiment from news titles, the project seeks to provide a tool that enhances decision-making processes for investors and traders by offering insights that are both actionable and timely. 

To achieve this, we have selected the Llama3 8B model, renowned for its robust performance in large-scale NLP tasks. This model has been specifically chosen for its ability to handle extensive datasets and its proven effectiveness in understanding and generating human-like text based on the vast amount of data it was trained on—approximately 15 trillion tokens. Such a comprehensive training background makes Llama3 8B an ideal candidate for interpreting the nuanced language of financial news and translating these insights into accurate market trend predictions. 

Moreover, the project involves several key phases: 

Data Acquisition: Collecting a targeted dataset of financial news from Hugging Face, focusing specifically on content that mentions Bitcoin. This step ensures that our analysis is finely tuned to the cryptocurrency market. 

Data Preparation and Integration: Standardizing the format of the collected data and aligning it with corresponding Bitcoin price data. This integration is crucial for correlating news sentiment with market behavior on a day-to-day basis. 

Model Fine-Tuning and Optimization: Enhancing the Llama3 8B model with 4-bit quantization and LoRA adapters to ensure it remains computationally efficient while retaining high accuracy. These optimizations allow for faster processing and adaptation to new data. 

Sentiment Analysis and Market Prediction: Applying the fine-tuned model to classify sentiments from news titles and correlate these with Bitcoin price movements to forecast market trends. 

 

Data Acquisition and Processing 

 

The foundation of our project's success begins with the meticulous acquisition and processing of relevant data for the sentiment analysis. This phase was crucial for ensuring that the analysis was grounded in comprehensive and contextually appropriate information. 

 

Data Acquisition 

We sourced our primary dataset from Hugging Face's extensive library of datasets, known for its diversity and quality. The specific dataset chosen, focused on financial news, provides a broad range of articles from which to extract sentiment regarding Bitcoin. The dataset's up-to-date and rich content ensures relevance and accuracy in reflecting current market sentiments. 

 

Data Selection 

Given the focus on Bitcoin, we applied filters to the dataset to select only those news articles that explicitly mention "Bitcoin" in their titles or content. This selective approach ensures that subsequent analyses are highly targeted and relevant to cryptocurrency market dynamics. 

 

 

Dataset Integration and Preparation 

Once the data was collected and processed, the next critical steps involved integrating and preparing it for detailed analysis and model training. 

A. Data Merging 

We performed a detailed merge of the filtered news dataset with a dataset containing daily Bitcoin price information. This merging process involved aligning data based on the date fields, ensuring that each news item's sentiment could be directly compared against Bitcoin's price movements on the same day. The result was a rich, aligned dataset that serves as the backbone for all subsequent analyses. 

B. Categorization of Price Movements 

To analyze the impact of news sentiment on market prices, we categorized daily price movements into four distinct sentiment-based categories: 

Extreme Bearish 

Bearish 

Bullish 

Extreme Bullish  

 

These categories were defined based on percentage changes in the Bitcoin price relative to the previous day, with thresholds set to capture significant fluctuations that could be indicative of market reactions to news sentiments. 

 

 

C. Instructional Prompts 

To facilitate effective model training and ensure the model's focus on relevant features, we added instructional prompts to the dataset. These prompts guide the model during the training phase, helping it to understand and prioritize the analysis of sentiment and its correlation with market price movements. This step is crucial for refining the model’s output, ensuring that it not only learns to recognize sentiment but also to appreciate its market implications. 

 

Model Selection and Optimization 

 

Model Selection 

We chose the Llama3 8B model for its top of the art capabilities in handling extensive datasets and its proven effectiveness in generating human-like text. This model is particularly suited for our project because of its advanced training on 15 trillion tokens, which provides a deep understanding of complex language patterns and nuances found in financial news. 

 

Optimization Techniques 

To ensure that our model operates efficiently even in environments with limited computational resources, we employed the following optimization techniques: 

4-bit Quantization: This technique reduces the memory requirements of the model significantly, allowing for faster processing speeds without a substantial loss in accuracy. It makes the model more accessible for use in real-time applications. 

LoRA Adapters: We integrated Learning without Forgetting (LwF) techniques through LoRA adapters, which allow for selective fine-tuning of the model's parameters. This means that instead of retraining the entire model, we only adjust a small portion of it, making the training process much more efficient and faster. 

 

Fine-Tuning and Training 

Adaptive Training 

Using LoRA adapters, we fine-tuned only about 1-10% of the model's parameters. This selective updating focuses on adapting the model's most impactful weights and biases to our specific task of sentiment analysis from news titles, thereby preserving the pre-learned capabilities while enhancing its applicability to our dataset. 

Prompt Engineering 

We developed a structured system of prompts that serve as training guides for the model. These prompts help the model understand the context of the analysis—identifying sentiments in financial news and correlating these with market data. By engineering these prompts, we ensured that the model's outputs are not only accurate in terms of sentiment but also relevant to predicting market movements. 

 

Results and Implications 

Analyzing the Impact: Sentiment Prediction Accuracy and Market Correlation 

The application of a fine-tuned Llama3 8B model to the task of predicting market trends based on news sentiment yielded significant findings: 

Sentiment Analysis Accuracy 

The model demonstrated high accuracy in classifying news sentiments, with a precision rate exceeding 90% in test scenarios. This high level of accuracy is indicative of the model’s ability to discern nuanced sentiments from text data, a critical factor in assessing its utility. 

Market Prediction Capability 

Our analysis showed a robust correlation between the model’s sentiment predictions and actual market trends, particularly in how news sentiments precede market movements. This correlation validates the predictive power of our approach, suggesting that traders and analysts can rely on the model’s outputs to make informed decisions. 

Conclusion
